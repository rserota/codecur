                        Rad Audio is a training ground and playground for music students, with added gamification to encourage learning.  The core app at Rad Audio is an interval tester, which helps musicians to train their relative pitch skills. Relative pitch is the ability to hear the relationship between multiple musical notes when they are played out loud. Users get points based on how quickly and accurately they can identify intervals, and their best scores are then posted to leaderboards so they can compare their progress with others.

                        The other main component to Rad Audio is a simple music-making app, which has two main parts.  It has a step sequencer, which allows the user to schedule a pattern of musical notes to play repeatedly.  This is used to create a bassline.  The other part is a live instrument, which allows the user to improvise melodies to play over their sequenced bassline.
